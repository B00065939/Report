# Introduction #

## Title ##
Project entitled

"INVESTIGATING SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT QUALITY THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF STUDENT TEAMWORK PROJECT SYSTEM"

conducted under the supervision of Dr. Matt Smith

## Background ##

One of the biggest challenges during studies for both students and lecturers are group projects. Students often do not know how to properly log and report group meetings. This situation has a negative impact on the quality and final evaluation of their projects.

From the perspective of teachers it is extremely difficult to assess the involvement of students in the group project. (Presence at the meetings, creativity, performance of scheduled tasks). Control of the progress of the project is limited in most cases to oral reports. In the case of supervision of several projects this situation can lead to a lack of control over their progress.

The aim of this project is to address this issue by designing and developing a web based system for managing Student teamwork project.

The system will be built in such a way to allow:

*	Planning meetings – creating agenda.
*	Managing student’s presence.
*	Recording minutes of meeting.
*	Managing and controlling progress of agreed actions/tasks.


## Main Research Question ##

To evaluate the use of open source tools and techniques for software validation and testing during developing an online system for group project meetings.

The complexity of current software projects forces developers to use several solutions for managing, testing and improving source code. The aim of this research is to find proper solutions, apply them and compare during development cycle.  

## Justification and benefits ##

The benefits of this project should be considered on two levels. From the system client’s, user’s and from the author’s perspective.

System user:

*	The system allows for better communication within the project between its members.
*	The system will allow better communication between the team and the supervisor.
*	The system will accelerate and unify planning and reporting meetings.
*	The system will allow for simplifying the supervision of performance, dependability and reliability of the individual team members.

Researcher:

*	Understanding and evaluation of various software solutions for managing, testing and improving coding quality.
*	Improving knowledge of full stack web development with use of Symfony framework
*	Improving knowledge of programing with use of OO PHP, HTML5, Java Script, CSS
*	Improving knowledge of designing a relative database MySQL.

## Feasibility ##

"A Feasibility Study is the first stage of the product or service development cycle. Its aim is to analyse the viability of a proposed project, product or service." [@overton2000]

### Technical requirements ###

*	For system user:
	*	Device with installed internet browser and broadband connection to Internet
*	For developer
	*	Hardware
		*	PC with 1024X768 minimum screen resolution
	*	Software
		*	IDE – PHP Storm
		*	Git repository hosting service – GitHub
		*	Local www server – Laragon

With the available budget, the failure of the author’s computer may result in delay.

### Human Resource Considerations ###

This project is an individual work and will be carried out by the author. The final result may be affected by many human factors, such as illness or being overwhelmed by the amount of work.

## Methodology ##

The project was conducted in a way to satisfy Agile software development life cycle (Figure1) [@blog.capterra]. Agile is a methodology created to describe software production cycle process when the designer, developer and tester are working together in recurring cycles. For an individual project one of the Agile techniques which can be used are Test Driven Development (TDD) or Behaviour Driven Development (BDD).
