# Literature Review #

The modern programming techniques are accompaniment by suite of tools. To research them I divided this project into three parts. First part when the application is designed. During this process the developer should decide which framework to use. Second part, the develop process when the application is written and tested, and the third part when the application’s performance is analysed.

The process of performance analysing is called profiling. To use any of the profiling tools like Xdebug (http://xdebug.org) or XHProof (http://xhproof.ie) the developer must know all performance issues and those can be discovered by benchmarking tools like Apache Bench (http://bit.ly/apache-bench) or Siege (http:joedog.org/siege-home). [@lockhart2015]

The foundation of this project is to focus on selecting and exploring PHP frameworks and developing the application with support of the testing tools so this literature review will be focused on selecting frameworks and testing tools.

## Frameworks overview ##

Since Web 2.0 the border between web pages and standard applications has becomes blurred and they have a shared name web apps. Web apps not only provide information but more importantly provides services to the user. All these changes have significantly influenced the complexity of modern apps forcing developers to find solutions for it. [@cuadrado2015] The solution to this problem is to use frameworks. 

PHP frameworks have several common features [@sklar2016]:

*	Routing – translate user request and invoke specific function to send response
*	Object-Related Mapping (ORM) – let the programmer use a database treating the database record as on object and providing set of functions to operate on the database.
*	User management – Mechanisms for managing users, authentication and authorization.

Like most programming languages PHP have their own frameworks. Three most popular are Laravel, Symfony and Zeng Framework.

Laravel

	“Love beautiful code? We do too.
	The PHP Framework for web Artisans” [@laravel]

	The distinctive feature of this framework is cloud solution Forge, when the programmer can have access to preinstalled Laravel.

Zend Framework

	“Professional PHP packages ready for PHP 7
	Focused on Simplicity, Reusability, and Performance” [@zend]

	Zend Framework is sponsored by Zend and Rouge Wave Company with contributions in many features with Google and Microsoft.

Symfony

	“Symfony is a set of reusable PHP components...
	... and a PHP framework for web projects” [@symfony]

	It is an Open Source PHP framework. Created by SesionLab and published in 2005 on MIT Open Licence. It is worth 	a mention the Symfony components are base for many other open source projects like Drupal, phpBB, Laravel, Joomla! and Composer. 

	The common feature of these projects is that they are made up of independent modules, packages or libraries. In order to manage them use a separate tool Composer. Composer [@getcomposer] is a package manager on a per-project base. Its two major tasks are:

1.	It enables you to declare the libraries you depend on.
2.	It finds out which version of which packages can and need to be installed.

## Testing Methodology ##

In typical types of application life cycle, testing was a separated part of the cycle often conducted by a separate team. Because of changing business requirements the developing life cycle process had to change as well. Testing the application entered into a new dimension where testing is parallel to coding. In 2001 a group of seventeen programmers published a set of rules for new methodology in software development, Agile was defined [@agilemanifesto]. To fulfil Agile methodology, programmers started with Test-Driven Development (TDD). TDD means you writing test before you start write application code [@lockhart2015]

Kent Beck in his book define two simple rules for Test-Driven Development [@kenet2002]:

1.	Don’t write a line of new code unless you have a failing automated test.
2.	Eliminate duplication.

This mean first you write the test then you write just enough code to past this test, then you refactoring this code. This process is repeated many times.
In TDD programmers are using PHPUnit programmer-oriented testing framework for PHP. It is an instance of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks [@phpunit]

PHPUnit prints results of the test in red colour when it fails and in green when the test is passed. This is why TDD cycle is called red/green/refactor. See figure 1 [@rgr] below.
 
![Red, Green and Refacto.](./02_figures/red_green_and_refactor.png)

PHPUnit test should be used to test every public class, method and function. Testing of each of these elements is conducted in isolation from other methods and functions. The outcome of TDD using Unit test is a granular and decoupled set of classes and functions. [@lockhart2015]

Despite the use of TDD, it is a big step forward in software production methodology, the problem of communication between team members is still unsolved because there is no language in which business team members or customers can directly communicate with the programmers. PHPUnit is too technical for this. [@slideshare]

Another testing methodology in software development is Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD). The programmer writes a story to describe the behaviour of an application. BDD has two types, SpecBDD and StoryBDD. [15]

SpecBDD technique uses PHPSpec framework. [@phpspec] SpecBDD is derived from Test-Driven Development, the different between SpecBDD and xUnit testing is a language, SpecBDD uses human-friendly language that makes it more focused on behaviour and code design. 
StoryBDD describes application business logic. Josh Lockhart in his book gives a simple and clean example to spot differences between StoryBDD and SpecBDD scope.

“StoryBDD resembles something a project manager would write (e.g., “this should generate and email me a report”). A SpecBDD test reassembles something a developer would write (e.g., “this class method should receive an array of data and write it to this PDF file”)” [@lockhart2015]

Behat framework is used for StoryBDD methodology. “A php framework for auto testing your business expectations” [@behat] Behat is a tool build of Symfony components. Behat scenarios are written in Gherkin which is a Business Readable, Domain Specific Language. Language that describes behaviour without describing implementation. The figure 2 [gherkin_code] below presents snippets of Gherkin code.

![Example of Gherkin code.](./02_figures/example_of_gherkin_code.png)


Chelimsky in his book presents a testing system assembled from RSpec and Cucumber. [@Chelimsky2010] Two BDD framework for Ruby, in PHP respectively PHPSpec and Behat. He describe BDD cycle when at each green test in RSpec cycle the programmer checks the Cucumber cycle. If the outside cycle is red the test result should lead back to the inner cycle, where the programmer refactors the code till it passes. When result is green the programmer repeats Cucumber cycle by writing another failing test. See figure 3 [@Chelimsky2010] bellow.
 
![BDD Life Cycle.](./02_figures/bdd_lifecycle.png)

In this example Cucumber focuses on the business logic and RSpec focuses on single function behaviour. Both these tools can replace each other’s role or work separately.
Conclusion
Using frameworks and components for PHP development the programmer can be sure that every component of this framework is well documented and tested, and this makes his work faster and free of errors. My personal choice is Symfony 3 framework whit the Composer as a package manager. For testing purpose I will create a system proposed by Chelimsky. Story Driven Development with use of Behave framework and SpecBDD with use of PHPSpec. Both testing frameworks installation is supported by Composer and there website documentation confirms compatibility with Symfony.
